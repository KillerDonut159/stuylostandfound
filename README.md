Lost and Found: The Website V1.0

Released!!

The python database has still yet to be implemented, but as of now we have a basic working version that can be updated daily (albeit, at a slower pace)

Roadmap:
- Implement database into catalogues
- Add a page which allows one to update catalogue directly from website itself
- Add a search function
