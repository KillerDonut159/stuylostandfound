Lost and Found: The Website V1.1

**MOBILE-FRIENDLY (ish)!!!!**
Finally made sidebar work such that mobile devices have a much easier time navigating
("Sidebar" is not really a sidebar but it is essentially a nav bar on mobile)

Python database has yet to be implemented into website, but we hope to get this done shortly!

Roadmap:
- Implement database into catalogues
- Add a page which allows one to update catalogue directly from website itself
- Add a search function
